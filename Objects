# Arithmetic Operators
# Description
# These unary and binary operators perform arithmetic on numeric or complex vectors (or objects which can be coerced to them).
# 
# Usage
# + x
# - x
# x + y
# x - y
# x * y
# x / y
# x ^ y
# x %% y
# x %/% y

# Mathematical objects

pi #number of pi

Inf #infinity

#Variable Names
# -> Make it readible
# -> Have to start with a letter
# -> Cannot contain spaces
# -> Avoid pre-existing functions
# -> Use meaningful words 
# -> Use underscores instead of spaces

?mean
